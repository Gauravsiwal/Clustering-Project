# A Data Driven Approach to Fund Allocation for HELP International NGO

**Introduction**

The objective of this project was to enhance the effectiveness of fund allocation for HELP International NGO by leveraging data-driven insights from clustering models. By analyzing socio-economic factors, we aimed to identify and categorize countries based on their development statusâ€”developed, developing, and underdeveloped. This approach enables more targeted interventions and ensures that resources are allocated where they are needed most.
